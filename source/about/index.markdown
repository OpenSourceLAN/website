## About the Open Source LAN Project

The Open Source LAN Project (OSL) was started to freely provide resources for people to run LANs with. 
And not just LANs - perhaps some of our work will be useful for online gamers, or even non-gamers!

The resources we aim to provide is made up of three areas:

* A knowledge base of annotated examples
* Blog posts containing tutorials and commentary
* Open source utilities and software


## Contributing and contacting us 

Most of our contributors are part of a LAN party technical team. However, this
is certainly not a prerequisite - contributions from all are welcome. 

If you have a small correction or bug to contribute, an article to publish
, are interested in becoming an ongoing contributor, or just want to say hi,
get in touch with us through one of the following means:

* Email us at squid@opensourcelan.com
* Join the [OpenSourceLAN Discord Server](https://discord.gg/0149LEvYPSzmnItKb)
* Message the moderators on the [OSL Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/opensourcelan)
* Post in the OSL subreddit introduction post
* Submit a merge request through Gitlab (note: public registration not open yet)
