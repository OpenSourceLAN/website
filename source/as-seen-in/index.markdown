# As seen in

Places where Open Source LAN software has been used. This list is made from places I've
seen people mention it publically, or people who let us know they use it.

*Have you used our software?* We'd love to know. [Get in touch with us!](http://opensourcelan.com/about/)

[Respawn LAN](http://www.respawn.com.au) uses most of it because that's where I test it :)

[PAX Australia](https://aus.paxsite.com) uses gameservers-docker, Service Discovery Helper,
Steam Hijack, Steam Discover, and other tools for the BYOC and PC Freeplay areas.

DreamHack DE [used Service Discovery Helper](https://github.com/OpenSourceLAN/service-discovery-helper/pull/1).

[epic.LAN](https://epiclan.co.uk) [uses Service Discovery Helper](https://github.com/OpenSourceLAN/service-discovery-helper/pull/1#issuecomment-272752779)

[Vectorama 2016](http://vectorama.info/) [used SteamDiscover](https://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/4nb8rs/vectorama_2016_trying_out_opensourcelans/) and integrated it in to a super cool looking Grafana dashboard.
